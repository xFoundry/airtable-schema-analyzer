    SHOW_FIELD_IDS: true,       // Display field IDs
    SHOW_RELATIONSHIPS: true,   // Analyze relationships
    SHOW_STATISTICS: true,      // Calculate statistics
    EXPORT_FORMAT: 'json'       // Default export format
};
```

### Onboarding
Help new team members understand your base structure quickly with exported documentation.

### Development
Use JSON export for programmatic base recreation or automated testing scenarios.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **View Configurations**: Detailed view configurations (filters, sorts) are not accessible via the Scripting API
- **Formula Details**: Formula expressions are not exposed through the API
- **Field Permissions**: Field-level permissions are not included in the analysis
- **Performance**: Large bases with many tables/fields may take longer to analyze
- **Attachment Contents**: The analyzer does not access actual file contents

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

The analyzer uses a class-based structure:

```javascript
class AirtableSchemaAnalyzer {
    constructor()           // Initialize schema object
    analyze()              // Main analysis function
    analyzeTable()         // Analyze individual table
    analyzeField()         // Extract field information
    analyzeView()          // Process view data
    analyzeRelationships() // Map linked records
    calculateStatistics()  // Generate statistics
    displayResults()       // Show interactive results
    exportSchema()         // Handle exports
}
```

### Field Categories

Fields are automatically categorized for better organization:

- **TEXT**: Text-based fields
- **NUMERIC**: Number-based fields
- **DATE**: Date and time fields
- **SELECT**: Choice-based fields
- **RELATIONAL**: Fields linking to other records
- **ATTACHMENT**: File attachment fields
- **CHECKBOX**: Boolean fields
- **USER**: Collaborator fields
- **COMPUTED**: Calculated fields
- **OTHER**: Special field types
